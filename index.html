            <p>I am a keen learner with a strong interest in technology and programming. Having an excellent understanding of C++ and Java, I am problem-solver by nature, curious to learn new things, and learning each and every day. Though I lack formal industry exposure as of now, I have developed projects on self-interest and interest to learn. I am a self-starter who is flexible and ready to make a difference in actual problems. I think that hard work, consistency, and creativity are the core strengths for success â€” and I stick by those values for each project that I undertake.</p>
